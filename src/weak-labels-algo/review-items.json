The experimental product had been reported at parity with (17|30)\n13: Salem Lights among both franchise and competitive smokers (Project 1982- (17|31)\n14: 151 and 1981-142). (17|32)\n15: This test is to assess current acceptability of BELAIR KS relative to key (16|35)\n16: menthol lights competition. MRD records indicate that this is the first (16|36)\n17: large scale consumer test of this product which is factory produced. (17|38)\n18: RESEARCH HYPOTHESIS (17|40)\n19: The currently available BELAIR KS product is perceived as equal to or better (17|43)\n20: than the major menthol lights KS competitor (Salem Lights) on the key (17|44)\n21: measures of preference and likability. (17|46)\n22: METHODOLOGY (17|48)\n23: Standard sequential monadic testing was conducted among 400 BELAIR KS (17|51)\n24: franchise smokers and 400 competitive menthol lights smokers. The (17|52)\n25: competitive smokers were representative of MSA share ranking of menthol (17|54)\n26: lights KS products. (17|55)\n27: Product for both brands was purchased at wholesale distributors and (17|58)\n28: masked at the Development Center. Interviewing was conducted during the (17|59)\n29: month of December, 1984. (17|60)\n30: KEY FINDINGS (17|63)\n31: Based upon the results of this project, the research hypothesis is rejected. (17|65)\n32: BELAIR Franchise (17|68)\n33: BELAIR KS achieved parity with Salem Lights KS on the measure of \"likability\". (17|71)\n34: However, a significantly larger proportion of BELAIR smokers expressed a (17|72)\n35: preference for Salem Lights vs. BELAIR. (17|74)\n36: Franchise smokers also rated BELAIR at parity with Salem Lights on the (17|76)\n37: attributes: comparison to own brand, strength, and draw. All other (17|78)\n38: attributes show BELAIR to be significantly less favorably perceived than (17|79)\n39: Salem Lights among BELAIR smokers.

(28|22)\n10: Communicate 1998 plans and design parameters. (28|25)\n11: Purpose:\tAs you are aware, the promoted volume % is one of the measures used extensively to (13|27)\n12: analyze the effectiveness of our discounting strategy at various levels in the Sales (25|29)\n13: organization (National, Regional, Division, Chain, etc.) Currently, this measure loses its (25|30)\n14: value as an indicator of performance as you drill down into the organization below a (25|32)\n15: National view due to the current Pay Point Methodology. Promoted volume measures (25|33)\n16: are significantly distorted under this methodology by not allowing the proper (25|35)\n17: geographical \"flow in\" and \"flow out\" of promotions. (25|36)\n18: Often Regional PV levels appear to be \"off strategy\" since large chain payments are (25|39)\n19: recorded against one pay point (Region) and cause PV levels to be unusually high in the (25|40)\n20: Region making the payment. To compensate, some ROUs are frequently \"spreading (25|42)\n21: this activity manually via the M72 function. With the new process, M72 entries will\tbe (25|43)\n22: significantly reduced as the activity will be spread as the payments are entered. (25|45)\n23: Additionally, this will simplify the entries and accuracy associated with the Retail Accrual (25|46)\n24: Statements. This will also provide the ability to capture chain promotional discounting (25|48)\n25: activity at the store level and to the geographical unit in which the activity occurs. (25|49)\n26: To improve the promoted volume % measure, several new options will be available in TPS to spread (13|52)\n27: promotional activity across chain accounts when a payment is made. (13|54)\n28: Spreading Options (Examples and Flow Chart Attached) (13|56)\n29: The following four spread options will be available January 1, 1998. (13|60)\n30: 1. The payment will be \"spread\" equally to each retail account in the chain. (13|62)\n31: 2. The payment will be \"spread\" based on the retail account's RJR SIS Weekly Volume in the chain. (13|64)\n32: 3. The payment will be \"spread\" based on an individual store list (with Options 1 or 2 above). (13|65)\n33: 4. The payment will be \"spread\" based on ROU defined Template (with Options 1 or 2 above). (13|67)\n34: This new design will require additional information to be obtained and entered in the ROU when a chain (13|70)\n35: headquarters payment is made. To facilitate the ROU data entry in TPS, additional information will be (13|71)\n36: needed on the current Voucher Request Forms at the time a payment is made (Refer to Attachment A (13|73)\n37: examples).

Since September (16|29)\n7: household data will not be available until next week, the month was extrapolated based (16|30)\n8: on trends in c-stores. Added to the resultant deal volume was media and direct mail (16|32)\n9: carton couponing delivered in September. In general, estimates are likelier to err on the (16|33)\n10: high side, because of the c-store methodology used for the Summer Special, and the (16|34)\n11: nature of the household panel. (16|36)\n12: Marlboro's total estimated 3Q % on deal is 12%. (16|39)\n13: It was estimated earlier that about $6MM of the Summer Special money did not make its (16|41)\n14: way to retail. If it had, the additional 24MM deal packs would raise the 12% estimate to (16|43)\n15: 14%. C-store audits indicate that the Summer Special bled into 4Q. Based on data (16|44)\n16: through October 19, an average of 5% of Marlboro's October volume was Summer (16|46)\n17: Special. Assuming the remainder of the month continues similarly, this would account (16|47)\n18: for about 2% of 3Q volume which fell into 4Q. (16|48)\n19: Finally, beginning mid-September, promotional 5-pack went to retail. SPACE currently (16|51)\n20: reports 24% of supermarkets with 5-pack. It is likely that a portion of 5-pack volume (16|53)\n21: sold in supermarkets was promotional during September, but InfoScan is not adequately (16|54)\n22: capturing the 5-pack's UPC, so a volume estimate is unavailable for now. (16|55)\n23: Overall, spending for about 16% of Marlboro's 3Q volume seem to be accounted for, (16|58)\n24: with a maximum of 12% representing actual deal volume at retail during the quarter.

A letter sent by (12|29)\n11: Whidden -- an American from Florida -- to Sen. Mack is attached. (12|31)\n12: In the letter, Whidden explains that it is his responsibility to (12|34)\n13: \"coordinate the campaign for fire-safe cigarettes in the British (12|35)\n14: Parliament and the European Parliament.

(13|55)\n27: Smith appreciated being made aware of the federal research, and (13|58)\n28: of the industry's own research. He assured me that Sen. Mack had (13|60)\n29: no interest in responding to Whidden's request, and that even (13|61)\n30: though the Senator is involved in the fight against cancer, he (13|63)\n31: cares about the tobacco industry too. Smith was not aware of who (13|64)\n32: else Whidden had visited or planned to visit.

(Environmental Technology, July (10|48)\n16: 1991). The authors have made several errors in their initial assumptions and (11|49)\n17: experimental techniques resulting in conclusions leading the reader to believe that \"an (10|51)\n18: important and relatively stable part\" of ETS nicotine is in the particulate phase. In (10|53)\n19: Figure 4a of the authors' paper, a concentration-time curve of nicotine in particulate and (10|55)\n20: gaseous phases of ETS suggests that almost 20% of ETS nicotine is present in the (10|56)\n21: particulate phase. In Figure 4b, a concentration-time curve is presented that shows an (11|58)\n22: ETS particulate phase nicotine concentration of approximately 1800 g/m\u00b3. Based on (10|60)\n23: work with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI/MS), (10|62)\n24: denuder tubes, electrostatic precipitation, and solid adsorbents, we demonstrated that (10|64)\n25: >95% of nicotine in ETS situations is in the vapor phase (1). Confirming our results in (11|65)\n26: a methods intercomparison study, researchers at Brigham Young University and Harvard (10|67)\n27: University demonstrated with acid-coated annular denuders that only 2-3% of ETS (10|69)\n28: nicotine is in the particulate phase (2). (10|71)\n29: The authors' collection system consists of borosilicate glass fiber filters and silica gel (10|74)\n30: tubes connected in series to partition the ETS nicotine into vapor and particulate phase (10|76)\n31: components. Unfortunately, this arrangement does not provide the straightforward (10|78)\n32: separation presumed. Borosilicate glass is inherently acidic due to the silica surface and (10|80)\n33: the presence of silanol groups. In addition, borosilicate glass contains metal oxides that (10|81)\n34: act as Lewis acids capable of interacting with electron-donating molecules such as (10|83)\n35: nicotine (3).

(10|43)\n19: However, there are a couple of places where I disagree with (16|46)\n20: your conclusions which I think are important. (10|48)\n21: I suppose you are familiar with the analysis made by Mensink (16|51)\n22: and Katan (Arterio Thrombosis 1992;12:911-9). They selected 27 (10|53)\n23: metabolic studies from the recent past in which fat composition (10|54)\n24: was varied but dietary cholesterol was kept constant. We have in (10|56)\n25: press (Am J Clin Nutr) an analysis of the published data over the (10|57)\n26: past 25-30 years. We divided the data into what we have called (10|59)\n27: \"metabolic studies\" where diets were prepared and fed to the (10|60)\n28: subjects and \"field trials\" where diet was varied by instruction (10|62)\n29: or provision of only some food. The early studies did not report (10|63)\n30: on serum lipoproteins so we also looked at the more recent data (10|65)\n31: where LDL and HDL were measured. (10|66)\n32: The major point to be made is that in none of these analyses- (16|69)\n33: ours or that of Mensink and Katan - can it be shown that the (10|71)\n34: monounsaturates have any effect upon serum cholesterol. Rather they (10|72)\n35: all show that saturates and dietary cholesterol elevate serum (10|74)\n36: cholesterol while polyunsaturates actively lower serum cholesterol. (10|75)\n37: The over-all data are consistent with what Keys et al and we (10|77)\n38: concluded 25-30 years ago although the size of the regression (10|78)\n39: coefficients varies depending upon which data set one analyzes.

This provision was rejected by conferees on the (14|25)\n9: Continuing Resolution for FY 86. However, the Assistant (14|27)\n10: Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) was directed to submit a (14|28)\n11: report by March 1, 1986, addressing health and other issues. (14|30)\n12: That report, \"Department of Defense Report on Smoking and (20|33)\n13: Health in the Military, resulted in the issuance of Defense (14|34)\n14: Department Directive 1010.10, signed by Deputy Secretary (14|36)\n15: William H.

(14|39)\n17: to improve military readiness and the quality of life of (20|40)\n18: DOD personnel and other beneficiaries.\" (14|42)\n19: The Directive sets forth guidelines for implementing the (20|43)\n20: Health Promotion Policy with specific reference to education (14|45)\n21: and the establishment of objectives in the areas of smoking (14|46)\n22: prevention and cessation, alcohol and drug abuse prevention, (14|48)\n23: physical fitness, nutrition, stress management, and early (14|49)\n24: identification of hypertension.

(14|77)\n37: Directive 1010.10 on the other hand, includes (20|80)\n38: requirements which have nothing to do with education or the (14|81)\n39: achievement of policy goals through education.

(11|52)\n23: But the report itself seems to indicate that the tar deliveries (19|55)\n24: of the Hong Kong cigarettes are extremely similar to their U.S. (11|56)\n25: counterparts.
